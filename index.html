                     <p>A little insight into her journey: Surabiha was born in Sri Lanka and spent 5 years there before embarking on a new adventure in Canada in the year 2005. After initially residing in Markham, she eventually settled in Scarborough, where she's called home for the majority of her life. As the eldest of three siblings, she's had the privilege of witnessing her younger brother and sister flourish into high school students.
                     Her childhood was filled with cherished memories of cozying up indoors with her favorite TV shows, bonding with cousins, and unleashing her creativity through countless art projects. A fun fact about her is her enduring passion for the arts and design, which has been a constant source of inspiration since her early years.
